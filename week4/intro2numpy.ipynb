    "As we discussed previously, the Python programming language provides a rich set of data structures such as the list, tuple, dictionary, and string, which can greatly simplify common programming tasks. Of these structures, all but the string are heterogeneous, which means they can hold data of different types. This flexibility comes at a cost, however, as it is more expensive in both computational time and storage to maintain an arbitrary collection of data than to hold a pre-defined set of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the Python list is implemented as a variable length array that contains pointers to the objects held in the array. While flexible, it takes time to create, resize, and iterate over, even if the data contained in the list is homogenous. Also, even though you can create multiple-dimensional lists, creating and working with them is neither simple nor intuitive. Yet, many applications require multi-dimensional representation, for example, location on the surface of the Earth or pixel properties in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, these data structures clearly are not designed or optimized for data intensive computing. Scientific and engineering computing applications have a long history of using optimized data structures and libraries, including codes written in C, Fortran, or MatLab. These applications expect to have vector and matrix data structures and optimized algorithms that can leverage these structures seamlessly.  Fortunately, since many data science applications, including statistical and machine learning, are built on this academic legacy, a community of open source developers have built the [Numerical Python (NumPy)](http://numpy.org) library, a fundamental numerical package to facilitate scientific computing in Python.\n",

Furthermore, NumPy provides additional benefits built on top of the `array` object, including masked arrays, universal functions, sampling from random distributions, and support for user-defined, arbitrary data-types that allow the `array` to become an efficient, multi-dimensional generic data container.\n",

    "### Universal Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy also includes methods that are universal functions, or [__ufuncs__][1], that are vectorized and thus operate on each element in the array, without the need for a loop. You have already seen examples of some of these functions at the start of this notebook when we compared the speed and simplicity of NumPy versus normal Python for numerical operations. These functions almost all include an optional `out` parameter that allows a pre-defined NumPy array to be used to hold the results of the calculation, which can often speed up the processing by eliminating the need for the creation and destruction of temporary arrays. These functions will all still return the final array, even if the `out` parameter is used. \n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy includes over sixty _ufuncs_ that come in several different categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Math operations, which can be called explicitly or implicitly when the standard math operators are used on NumPy arrays. Example functions in this category include `add`, `divide`, `power`, `sqrt`, `log`, and `exp`.\n",
    "- Trigonometric functions, which assume angles measured in radians. Example functions include the `sin`, `cos`, `arctan`, `sinh`, and `deg2rad` functions.\n",
    "- Bit-twiddling functions, which manipulate integer arrays as if they are bit patterns. Example functions include the `bitwise_and`, `bitwise_or`, `invert`, and `right_shift`.\n",
    "- Comparison functions, which can be called explicitly or implicitly when using standard comparison operators that compare two arrays, element-by-element, returning a new array of the same dimension. Example functions include `greater`, `equal`, `logical_and`, and `maximum`.\n",
    "- Floating functions, which compute floating point tests or operations, element-by-element. Example functions include `isreal`, `isnan`, `signbit`, and `fmod`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the official [NumPy _ufunc_][1] reference guide for more information on any of these functions, for example, the [isnan][2] function, since the user guide has a full breakdown of each function and sample code demonstrating how to use the function. \n",
