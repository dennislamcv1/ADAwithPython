    "## Python Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "As the Python language has become more popular, individuals and organizations have invested considerable time, energy, and effort in developing Python applications. One hallmark of good application design is _reusability_. After all, who wants to rewrite the same code multiple times to solve the same problem? Fortunately, the Python language supports encapsulating code into [modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html), which are essentially files containing Python definitions, for example, functions, classes, or variables. A _module_ can be imported into another Python file, allowing the definitions to be reused. \n",
    "\n",
    "When one or modules are more widely used, they can be bundled together into a Python package, which can provide enhanced functionality. To import a package (or module) into another Python program, you use the `import` statement, which has the following forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `import numpy`\n",
    "2. `import numpy as np`\n",
    "3. `from numpy import arange`\n",
    "4. `from numpy import *`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first form brings the entire contents of the NumPy package into the current program but leaves all items in the NumPy namespace. Thus, to refer to a particular definition, like `arange` one must use the `numpy` prefix, as in `numpy.arange()`. The second form is similar to the first, but the prefix has been shortened to `np`. Thus, you refer to a definition, like `arange` by using `np.arange()`. The third form only imports the single, listed definition, which is also brought into the current namespace and thus does not require any prefix. The last form brings the entire contents of the NumPy package into the current file and namespace. As a result, the chances for name collisions increase, and thus the last form is strongly discouraged. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in this course we generally use the first form for system libraries, like `sys` (i.e., `import sys`), and the second form for third-party libraries, like `numpy` (i.e., `import numpy as np`). In general, the appropriate `import` format will be demonstrated in future lessons for each module when it is introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many popular packages have been included with the standard Python distributions and are known collectively as the Python [standard library][psl]. This includes items like [`sys`][ps] for working with the computer system directly, [`math`][pm] to work with mathematical constants and functions, [`csv`][6] to work with comma-separated value files, and [`datetime`][dt] to manipulate dates and times. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other packages are available from third parties and can be very useful in specific circumstances. The following table lists some of the more popular Python packages that are relevant for this course: \n",
    "\n",
    "| name              | Description                              |\n",
    "| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| [numpy][1]        | Fast numerical arrays and matrices       |\n",
    "| [scipy][2]        | Comprehensive set of scientific and engineering functions |\n",
    "| [matplotlib][3]   | Comprehensive plotting library           |\n",

    "| [pandas][5]       | Data structures and simplifies data analysis tasks |\n",
    "| [scikit_learn][8] | Provides machine learning tools          |\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these listed packages, many other packages exist. The official repository for public Python packages is PyPI, the [Python Package Index][pypi]. These libraries can generally be installed with [pip][pip], the Python package management tool, or with [conda][ac]; however, the details of doing this are beyond the scope of this course.\n",

    "\n",
    "Working with modules is extremely easy in Python. First, we must import the module. As stated earlier, for modules in the [standard Python library](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html), the standard approach is to simply import the module:\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import my_module as mm\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following Code cell, we demonstrate how to import the `sys` module, which enables a programmer to interact with the Python  interpreter. To demonstrate working with this module, we display the `version_info` for our Python interpreter. In the second Code cell, we demonstrate how to import the `collections` module. With this module we create and display a `Counter` data structure, which maintains the count for each item in the collection. In addition to viewing the online documentation for a module, you can also use the Python interpreter to learn about a module by using the built-in `help` function. You also can see a concise list of defined objects, such as variables and functions, for a module by using the built-in `dir` function.\n",

    "Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most common kind of complaint you get while you are still learning Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/syntax_error.png' />\n",
    "\n",
    "The parser repeats the offending line and displays a little ‘arrow’ pointing at the earliest point in the line where the error was detected. The error is caused by (or at least detected at) the token preceding the arrow: in the example, the error is detected at the end of for loop, since a colon (':') is missing. File name and line number are printed so you know where to look in case the input came from a script. Syntax errors must be fixed or the python code won't be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "A well written program(without syntax errors) can still have errors. Errors detected at run time is called exceptions. Or data that is being analyzed can have errors. You may have encountered error messages when working with a Jupyter notebook, such as the error shown in the following screenshot:\n",
    "\n",
    "![value_error](images/value_error.png)\n",

    "Above code tries to add up list of sales to get total sales. Since the sales figures are in string format, it's converted to float first with `float(s)` which can't handle `$99` because of the `$`. Thus a specific `ValueError` was thrown. The **Traceback** also indicates the line that caused the exception to be thrown. Often this enables the error condition to be identified and corrected. In this case it is the string `$99` that caused the error. We may first strip the `$` from `s` before converting to float: `total_sales += float(s.replace('$', ''))`\n",

    "### Handling Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Unhandled exceptions will terminate python code unexpectedly. It is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions. Python provides several statements that enable a programmer to gracefully handle exceptions as they arise. Formally, we use a try statement to identify a code block that might throw an exception. Following this code block, we have one or more except statements that catch an exception and either try to fix the problem or log the error so that the problem can be corrected at a later time.\n",
    "Thus, this exception handling mechanism is coded in the following manner:\n",
    "```\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Do something that might cause exceptions\n",
    "except ExceptionName:\n",
    "    # Do something to recover or log the problem when ExceptionName occurs\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the following Code cell, we use this exception handling mechanism to handle division by zero error. Now, however, we catch the ZeroDivisionError exception and set our answer to None since no valid value could be determined, and print a descriptive message (in a production system we would write a similar message to a log file)."

    "Datetime is one of the most common feature in business related dataset. Datetime is normally stored as strings with different format, ie. `Mar 31, 2019`, `2019-03-31 13:00:00`, `31.03.2019`. We usually need to convert datetime strings to python `datetime` object. Python `datetime` class has a function [`strptime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior) specifically for this task.\n",
    "Following code will convert `2019-03-31 13:00:00` to datetime object. Note that `datetime` module has many classes, of which we will use `datetime` class. That's why we import the `datetime` class with `from datetime import datetime`. It's an coincidence that the class name is same as module name. There're other useful date time related classes in the module, ie. `timedelta`"
