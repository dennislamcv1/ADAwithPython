    "| Operator  | Description             | Example                    |\n",

    "| not  | **not** operator, opposite of condition       | `not a`|\n",
    "\n",
    "These operators are fairly self-explanatory, but one important issue is that the Python operator will stop evaluating a conditional statement as quickly as possible. Thus, if the first part of an `and` operation is `False` (or, conversely `True` for an `or` operation), the remaining part of the statement will not be processed since the overall result will be `False`. This approach is known as _short-circuiting_ and can produce faster code execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "These operators are demonstrated in the following Code cells, where we first define several Boolean variables before showing how to use each operator. In general, it is recommended to use parentheses to explicitly indicate operator order. Otherwise, one must be very careful to understand and follow the rules of operator precedence.\n",

This is demonstrated in the following Code cell.\n",
