Likewise, this can occur if a data set has a number of outliers at one end of a range (such as sales contracts that are much higher than the rest of the sales contracts in a list).

A mode can also make sense when data are categorical, or explicitly limited to a discrete set of values. In following cell we will find out the most common group size of a meal. Notice that since `size` is a keyword to pandas, we can't refer to the `size` column with `tips.size` as we do for `total_bill` above, we have to use `tips['size']` instead.
