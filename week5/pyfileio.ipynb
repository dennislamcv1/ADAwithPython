    "## Working with Files\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with files, or any other system object, we must be careful about properly managing the underlying resource. In this particular case, that means a file and the associated file descriptor that the host operating system uses to reference the actual file. Whenever we open a file, we want to be sure that the file is properly closed and that any data that a program wrote to the file has been written to permanent storage. Thus, we need to ensure that every file that was opened has been properly closed. To open a file, Python has an `open` method that opens the named file and returns a file object that you either read from or write to depending on the mode used to open the file. Conversely, Python also has a `close` method that closes the file object. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explicitly state why a file is being opened, the `open` method accepts a _mode_ argument, whose default values is `rt` or _open for reading text data_. The allowed modes are detailed in the following table.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mode | Description                       |\n",
    "| ---- | --------------------------------- |\n",
    "| 'r'  | reading (default)                 |\n",
    "| 'w'  | writing, truncate file first      |\n",
    "| 'x'  | create and open file for writing  |\n",
    "| 'a'  | writing, append to file if exists |\n",
    "| 'b'  | binary mode                       |\n",
    "| 't'  | text mode (default)               |\n",
    "| '+'  | open for reading and writing      |\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, you would only read from a text file or write to a text file by using traditional Python file input and output (with the advent of powerful data science modules in Python, however, we now often read and write data directly from advanced data structures like a Pandas `DataFrame`). Thus, to open a text file named `test.txt` for writing without truncating the existing file contents (i.e., append), you would use `f = open('test.txt', 'a')`, and after all operations on the file are complete, you would use `f.close()` to close the file and release all associated resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, file input/output employs a runtime [context](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html?highlight=context%20manager#with-statement-context-managers), which is a way to enforce what should happen when a code block is entered and exited. The _context_ is created by using the `with` command in Python, where the rest of the line following the `with` command creates the actual context, which manages the entry into and exit from the enclosed code block. For our purposes, the standard application for a Python context is opening and closing files. As demonstrated in the following code block, we can now open a file, perform operations on the file, and no longer worry about closing the file, which is now taken care of automatically by the context.\n",

Next, we open the file as `fout`, after which we write two lines before exiting the context, which closes the file and ensures the text data are correctly written to the file.

    "The `open` method also takes an `encoding` attribute that can be used to specify the character encoding used in the file.  Originally, the only character encoding used by computers was the ASCII encoding, which only required 8-bits to represent each character. This encoding only represented the standard American typewriter characters and thus failed to work for non-English languages or words. To support character encodings for any language, the [Unicode Consortium](http://www.unicode.org) was formed and standardized character encodings were subsequently developed. One of the most popular current character encodings is `utf-8`, which is a Unicode standard. \n"

We also explicitly indicate that the index column is 'iata', which is the airport code.

Second, we write the DataFrame in the CSV format. Finally, we read the CSV file into a new DataFrame and display the first few rows for comparison with the original DataFrame. Notice that this time when we call `pd.read_csv` we don't set `delimiter` since the data is separated by comma. We also don't set `index_col`, the result DataFrame then has default index and `iata` is loaded as a regular column."

To pickle data to a file, you  must import the pickle module and open a file in binary writing mode `'wb'`.
