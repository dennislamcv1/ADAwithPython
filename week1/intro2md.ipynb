To make a simple unordered list, we simply prefix the list entries (that is a line) by a dash `-`, single asterisk `*`, or plus `+` character. To create a nested list, you indent the nested list by one or more spaces. For consistency, I prefer to use the dash `-` character to indicate unordered lists. For example, the following Markdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Item 1\n",
    "- Item 2\n",

    "- Item 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered lists are similar, but are prefixed by numbers and a period, for example `1.` for the first item. The Markdown numbers used to indicate list items do not have to start at one, nor must they be sequential. As an example, the text generated from the following Markdown will be formatted to begin at one and proceed sequentially.\n",

The LaTeX formulae are translated for display in a web browser by the [MathJax][2] Javascript display engine. \n",
    "\n",
    "To indicate a LaTeX formula, the simplest approach is to enclose the relevant LaTeX between dollar sign characters, `$ ... $` or to make the expression appear on its own line you enclose the expression between double dollar sign characters, `$$ ... $$`. Many specific functions or math symbols are prefixed with a forward slash character, `\\`. For example, to write the LaTeX formula for lowercase Greek character theta, you would write `$\\theta$`. The [support for mathematical expressions][3] in LaTeX is quite extensive, and there are tools, such as [LaTeXit][4] or browser add-ons that can help build and test LaTeX expressions.\n",
