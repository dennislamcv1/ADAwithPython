    "Whether you realize it or not, as you surf the Internet you're interacting with a variety of database-backed web applications. This nomenclature may be unfamiliar, but it simply means that a website you visit is dynamically created using data saved in a database. To demonstrate, consider the following types of web sites that you may visit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An information portal, like [Yahoo][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "- A newspaper web site to catch up on the local news or sports\n",
    "\n",
    "- A financial web site, like that of a bank or investment institution, to monitor your financial portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "- A map website to find driving directions\n",
    "\n",
    "- A search engine where you can identify interesting web sites for more detailed information on a subject\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these examples use databases to store, locate, and retrieve information dynamically. In each of these applications, the website collects necessary information from the user (such as a street address), queries the application database, and collects the data that has been requested into a suitable visual result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these database systems are large and complex, imagine holding all the map information needed to provide accurate driving directions with pictures! Clearly, storing data and making it available to applications is a big task, one that has been addressed by a number of commercial vendors who provide different solutions that are optimized for different tasks. Many of these open-source or commercial database systems provide full, enterprise-class capabilities. As a result, they can hold enormous quantities of data, concurrently interact with a large number of users, and scale across large computational systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can broadly classify these systems into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relational database management systems like the open-source [MySQL][2] and [PostgreSQL][3], and commercial systems like [IBM DB2][4], [Microsoft SQL Server][5], or [Oracle Database][6] that rely on a tabular data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. NoSQL (or Not only SQL) systems that abandon the tabular data model to achieve a simpler design, better scaling or higher availability than is traditionally possible with relational databases. NoSQL databases can be classified based on their data model, and include key-store databases like Amazon's [Dynamo][7], Object Databases like [ZopeDB][8], document store databases like [MongoDB][9], and column databases like  [Cassandra][10] or [HBase][11], which are open source implementations of Google's [BigTable][bt] model.\n",

    "### ACID Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Diamonds are obviously a valuable commodity, so valuable that counterfeits are a serious concern. One simple and (at least, in the movies) popular test to determine whether a diamond is real is to run it across a piece of glass. Because diamonds are one of the hardest materials known, a real diamond easily cuts the glass surface; a fake, especially if it's made of glass itself, won't.\n",
    "\n",
    "To a software developer, databases are equally valuable. If you use a database, you want to be sure it will safely store your data and let you easily retrieve the data later. You also want your database to allow multiple programs (or people) to work with the database without interfering with each other. To demonstrate, imagine you own a bank. The database for your bank must do the following, among other things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Safely store the appropriate data\n",
    "- Quickly retrieve the appropriate data\n",
    "- Support multiple, concurrent user sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks can be collectively referred to as the ACID test; ACID is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Atomicity** means that operations with the database can be grouped together and treated as a single unit. This unit of work, typically bundled as a *transaction*, ensures that either all operations are performed successfully (a *commit*), or none of them are performed (a *rollback*). In other words, a database can't be in an unfinished state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consistency** guarantees that only valid data are written to the database, and that this process follows all rules and constraints present in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand why these two characteristics are important, think about a bank transaction during which money is transferred from a savings account into a checking account. If the transfer process fails after subtracting the money from your savings account and before it was added to your checking account, you would lose money, and the bank would have an angry (ex)customer! Atomicity enables the two operations: the subtraction from the savings account and the addition to the checking account, to be treated as a single transaction. Consistency guarantees only valid data is written during the transaction or rollback. That way, your money isn't lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Isolation** means that independent sets of database transactions are performed in such a way that they don't conflict with each other. Continuing the bank analogy, consider two customers who transfer funds between accounts at the same time. The database must track both transfers separately; otherwise, the funds could go into the wrong accounts, and the bank might be left with two angry (ex)customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Durability** guarantees that the database is safe against unexpected terminations. It may be a minor inconvenience if your television or computer doesn't work when the power goes out, but the same can't be said for a database. If the bank's computers lose power when transferring your funds, you won't be a happy customer if the transaction is lost. Durability guarantees that if the database terminates abnormally during a funds transfer, then when the database is brought back up, it will be able to recover the transaction and continue with normal operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Passing the ACID test is nontrivial, and many simple databases fall short. For critical e-business or Web-based applications, passing the ACID test is a must. This is one of the reasons so many companies and individuals utilize enterprise-level database systems, such as Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, or IBM DB2. These databases are fully compliant with the ACID test and can meet many of the data persistence needs of large corporations or organizations. However, to do so often requires a large team that includes database administrators, database developers, and database application developers to ensure that data is effectively persisted and available as necessary for business applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "A relational database stores data in relations made up of records with fields. The relations are usually represented as tables; each record is usually shown as a row, and the fields as columns. In most cases, each record will have a unique identifier, called a key, which is stored as one of its fields. Records may also contain keys that refer to records in other tables, which enables us to combine information from two or more sources. \n",

A table name must be unique within a given schema. Thus, by using schemas, you can have identically named objects (such as tables) enclosed within different schemas. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an abstract sense, these database concepts may seem confusing, but in practice they're fairly straightforward. For example, imagine you own a store called Bigdog's Surf Shop that sells a variety of items like sunglasses, shirts, and so on. If you want to be profitable, you must keep a close eye on your inventory so you can easily order additional inventory or change vendors to keep your overhead to a minimum. One simple method for tracking this information is to write entries in a table-like format:\n",

    "| Supplier# | Supplier Name |\n",
    "| ----- | ---------- |\n",
    "| 101 | Mikal Arroyo |\n",
    "| 102 | Quiet Beach Industries |\n",
    "\n",
    "**<DIV ALIGN=CENTER>Product Table </DIV>**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Item# | Price | Supplier# | Stock Date | Description |\n",
    "| ---- | ----- | ---- | ---------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| 1 | 29.95 | 101 | 1/15/15 | Basic Sunglasses |\n",
    "| 2 | 9.95 | 101 | 12/14/14 | Generic Shirt |\n",
    "| 3 | 99.95 | 102 | 8/04/14 | Boogie Board |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From this simple visual design you can easily map the business logic straight into database tables. You have two database tables, `Suppliers` and `Products`, which are naturally linked by the supplier number. The data types for the columns in each table are easy to determine. Later in this lesson we will actually create this sample schema for Bigdog's Surf Shop, which consists of these two tables, in a SQLite database. "

As a result, you may expect that every database has its own application programming interface (API) and that these APIs may be different from one system to the next. When relational databases were first developed, this was the case; but, fortunately, a number of vendors agreed to develop a standard language for accessing and manipulating relational databases. This language is officially called Structured Query Language (or SQL, pronounced sea-quill). \n",

Fortunately, open-source, ACID-compliant database systems exist, including the zero-configuration, serverless relational database system known as [SQLite][1]. By using SQLite, you can learn to work with a relational database either by using SQL or by using the Python programming language.

    "### SQLite Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is quite different than traditional relational database systems. SQLite does not have a separate server process, instead SQLite is a software library that, as the website states:\n",
    "\n",
    "> implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration,\n",
    "> transactional SQL database engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before progressing, lets examine each of these concepts in turn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Self-contained*: Nothing else is needed to use SQLite but the software library. Since, by default,  this comes with Python, we can use SQLite without any additional software downloads or installs. In addition, if you want to embed SQLite in your own application, you can obtain a single ANSI-C file that contains the entire SQLite library.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Serverless*: We interact with the SQLite database by using the SQLite library. The database is stored in a single file that is platform independent (so you can simply copy it over to a new machine with no further effort).\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Zero-configuration*: SQLite does not use a server process, so there is no configuration required. While you can customize SQLite to change [default limits][1], for most applications this is unnecessary. You can also pre-specify certain options for the `sqlite3` command line client in a separate configuration file (e.g., `.sqliterc`, which is located in the current user's home directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Transactional*: A transaction is a logical set of operations. SQLite is ACID-complaint by implementing [atomic commits][2], which means that either every operation within the transaction completes successfully or none of them do. No partial writes are persisted, so that the database is always in a consistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this power, it is even more surprising that the SQLite library is quite small and can be compacted to as small as **300 kb** if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite by default will store data in a single database file; however, it can also be used as an _in memory_ database. SQLite has been distributed as a component within the Python language for many years, but also has a stand-alone command line interface client, called `sqlite3` that we will use in this lesson to create a database, create schema within that database, and to import data.\n",

    "### SQLite Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL, being a programming language in its own right, defines a rich data-type hierarchy. Persisting these data types is one of the most important responsibilities of the database. As databases have become more powerful, this type hierarchy has grown more complex. But most simple databases don't require the full range of allowed types, and often they need to store only numerical, character, and date or time data. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the SQL standard defines basic [data types][1], different database systems can support the standard to varying degrees. While this might seem odd, doing so provides more flexibility in allowing a particular implementation to achieve a market niche. In the case of SQLite, the design decisions support a compact, zero-configuration database file that is platform-independent. As a result, [SQLite does not support][2] a rich data type hierarchy, and instead focuses on ease-of-use. \n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite supports five storage classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NULL**: A null value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **INTEGER**: A signed integer, the number of bytes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8) used depends on the magnitude of the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **REAL**: A floating-point value stored as an 8 byte IEEE floating-point value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TEXT**: A string of character values stored in the default database encoding (e.g., UTF-8).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BLOB**: A blob of data stored *exactly* as is in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that SQLite does not support Boolean or Date/Time values directly. Instead, Boolean values are encoded as INTEGERs (0 = False, 1 = True). Likewise Date/Time values can be encoded either as TEXT, REAL, or INTEGER values. For full details, see the [SQLite documentation][sd]. \n",

    "### SQL Select\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SQL programming language, the task of performing a query falls to the SELECT statement. To provide all the query functionality required by database applications, the SELECT statement's capabilities are extensive. Before looking at example SELECT statements, lets first look at the  formal syntax of SELECT, which, as shown below is actually simple. The basic format is `SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE;`, where you select the columns of interest from rows in a table or tables where certain conditions are satisfied. Of course, things can become considerably more complex. This section covers the basic features of SELECT and defers the more advanced issues to the official documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT [ DISTINCT | ALL ] SelectItem [ , SelectItem ]*\n",
    "FROM clause\n",
    "[ WHERE clause ]\n",
    "[ GROUP BY clause ]\n",
    "[ HAVING clause ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From this you can see that a basic SELECT statement requires only a SELECT and a FROM; you must specify what data to select and indicate the location of the data of interest. Everything else is optional (as indicated by the square brackets). The DISTINCT and ALL keywords are optional qualifiers to indicate that either rows with unique values or all rows should be selected, respectively. By default, ALL is implicitly assumed, and you can use only one DISTINCT qualifier per SELECT statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "A SELECT statement can have multiple columns listed following the SELECT keyword. Multiple elements (or, more generally, column names) are separated by commas. For example, `SELECT a, b, c` selects the three columns `a`, `b`, and `c`. To select all columns from a table, you can use the asterisk character (`*`) as a shorthand for all columns. An important point to remember is that the result of any SELECT statement is a transient SQLite table, and you can use it in many of the same ways you use a more permanent table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FROM component of a SELECT statement indicates from which table (or multiple tables) the data will be extracted. For now, we will focus on selecting data from a single table; latter we will cover table joins and selecting data from multiple tables. In this case, the fully qualified name of the table to query must follow the FROM keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the SELECT statement is optional. Before you build your first query, however, lets review the order in which the SELECT statement components are evaluated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. FROM clause\n",
    "2. WHERE clause\n",
    "3. GROUP BY clause\n",
    "4. HAVING clause\n",
    "5. SELECT clause\n",
    "\n",
    "When you break down the process SQLite follows when processing a query, this order is intuitive. First, you must locate the data to be analyzed, after which you filter out the rows of interest. The next steps are to group related rows and, finally, to select the actual columns of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate a SELECT statement, we can extract all the columns from the `myProducts` table by using the `sqlite3` tool and passing the SQL statement in as a command line argument.\n",

This can be a useful shortcut, especially when you're developing database applications, but it isn't a recommended practice. By using the shortcut, you don't explicitly specify the database column names or their order. In a database application, if you always assume that the column names and their order in a table are fixed, you may end up with subtle bugs if someone else modifies the database tables on which your application depends. You should always explicitly name the database columns in your SELECT statements and list the order you require.\n",

Finally, the DROP TABLE statement deletes the empty table from the schema.\n",

To do this, you create an appropriate WHERE clause that identifies all rows of interest.

The basic building blocks for constructing a Boolean expression within a WHERE clause were presented in an earlier table.
