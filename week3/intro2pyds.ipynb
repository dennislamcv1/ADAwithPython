    "Python provides built-in support for a number of useful data structures, including the four introduced in this notebook: string, tuple, list, and dictionary. In this section, we briefly introduce these four data structures and provide an example of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "__String__: \n",
    "A sequence of zero or more characters that are enclosed within either a pair of single quote characters, `'`, or a pair of double quote characters, `\"`. A Python string is an instance of class `str`.\n",

    "`'A string containing many characters'`\n",
    "\n",
    "__Tuple__:\n",
    "An ordered sequence of zero or more values that are enclosed in parentheses, `(` and `)`. The different values in a tuple are generally separated by commas. A Python tuple is an instance of class `tuple`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)`\n",
    "\n",
    "__List__:\n",
    "An ordered sequence of zero or more values that are enclosed in square brackets, `[` and `]`. The different values in the list are separated by commas. A Python list is an instance of class `list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`\n",
    "\n",
    "__Dictionary__:\n",
    "An **unordered** collection of key-value pairs that are enclosed in curly braces, `{` and `}`. A key is separated from its corresponding value by a colon `:` and the different key-value entries in the collection are separated by commas. A Python dictionary is an instance of class `dict`.\n",

    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these four data structures, the _list_ and the _dictionary_ are **mutable**, which means the values stored in these structures can be changed. On the other hand,  the _string_ and the _tuple_ are **immutable**, which means the values cannot be changed once created. Instead, a new data structure must be created, either explicitly by the programmer, or implicitly by the Python interpreter. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these data structures can be displayed by using the Python built-in `print` function, which converts its arguments to a string, which is then sent to STDOUT (which in this course is generally the space in the notebook immediately following the `print` function):\n",

    "```\n",

    "The _dictionary_ is a special data structure that maps keys to values, and thus the keys, which can be stored in any order, are used to access the values. The other three structures are ordered sequences, and thus individual elements can be accessed by specifying an index position within square brackets, `[]`, with the caveat that Python is a zero-indexed language. Thus, given an ordered sequence `data`, the following accesses are legal:\n",

While it might seem confusing to have two such similar representations, it can be quite handy, as this allows strings to be written that include either single quotes or double quote characters by simply using the opposite type to enclose the string itself:\n",

    "## Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports a rich array of techniques for extracting values from an ordered list beyond the single value access method, known as slicing. Given an ordered sequence `data`, the basic format is `data[start:end:stride]` where start and end are the starting and ending index values, respectively, and stride is the number of values to skip when iterating. If start or end are omitted, the default is the first and last value, while the default stride is one. A negative value can be used for either the start or the end index values, which indicates relative to the end value. In `data[start:end:stride]`, `start` has default value 0, `end` has default value which is the length of the object, `stride` has default value `1`. If a value is not provided, default value will be used. So `data[::]` or `data[:]` means *slice data from beginning to end with stride 1*, which has same data as `data`. When `start` or `end` is negative, it means count from behind. `stride` can also be negative which means traverse backwardly. Starting index value is included and ending index value is **not** included in the slicing result. These concepts are demonstrated in the following code block:"
