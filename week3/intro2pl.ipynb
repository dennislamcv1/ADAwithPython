The following loops demonstrate the use of the `for` loop to iterate through the items in different Python data structures. First, we iterate over the items in the list; in this example, we process each item and display the result.\n",

This can be used to control what is printed (or displayed) after the print statement completes. Normally this is a newline character (`\\n`), which results in the next `print` statement displaying text on a new line. In this example, we want multiple values within the inner iteration to be displayed on the same line, so we define `end=''`, which means nothing is printed after the end of each line. The second use instead displays a space after the text is displayed because we use `end=' '`. Finally, after the inner iteration, we use a blank print statement to print a single newline, followed by a second print statement that creates and prints a string of twelve dashes.\n",

The formalism for either a [_list comprehension_](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) or a _dictionary comprehension_ is to simply place Python code inside the respective characters that are used to create a new list or dictionary, respectively. This code generally involves an iterative process that uses a `for` loop and can also include an optional conditional statement. For example, the following code creates a list with elements that are the squared value of the integers from zero to nine.\n",
