    "In Python, it is important to remember that a string is an instance of the `str` class. While that this might seem confusing, or an unneeded distraction, in practice this simply means that you get additional functionality for (almost) free. In this section, we explore this additional functionality by demonstrating some of the more important string functions. Primarily these extra functions can be used to process string data and testing if the string only contains alphabetical values, numerical values, or alphanumeric values. However, there are functions that can convert a string to all lowercase or uppercase characters, find substrings, replace data, and format text data\n",
    "\n",
    "A full description of the string methods is available from the online [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) or by using `help(str)` at a Python prompt or in a Jupyter notebook cell. We now demonstrate some of the more common and useful string functions.\n"

    "\n",
    "__`format`__:\n",
    "\n",
    "The format method is used to create a new formatted string from a template string and substitution text. The classic example is a form letter, where specific fields are replaced by new data with every string. The `format` method replaces the previous `%` string formatting operator. In its basic form, the template string includes identified `{}` to indicate replacement string locations, and the format method takes arguments that are used to indicate the replacement text. For example,\n",

    "```python\n",
    "'Hello {}, you are visitor #{}!'.format('Alexander', 23)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'Hello Alexander, you are visitor #23!'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the curly braces can enclose a number that is used to find the matching variable for substitution in the `format` method. For example, the previous example could also be written as `'Hello {0}, you are visitor #{1}!'.format('Alexander', 23)`, or equivalently as `'Hello {1}, you are visitor #{0}!'.format(23, 'Alexander')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, however, we will primarily use the [_f-strings_](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/) to create formatted text strings. As a reminder, we get the same functionality when using an f-string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = 'Alexander'\n",
    "number = 23\n",
    "\n",
    "f'Hello {name}, you are visitor #{number}!'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "f-String was added in Python 3.6. If you look at older code, or work with programmers who have used Python for a while, you will likely  run across the `format` method. The two approaches use many of the same formatting concepts, so it is generally straightforward to translate between them, as demonstrated in the following Code cell.\n",

The string you use to call the `join` method provides the _glue text_ between each item in the iterable. For example, the following method will create a new string from a list of strings that are each separated by a comma and a single space character:\n",

Thus, any function that operates on a `tuple` is different than the corresponding function that works on a `list`. First, any sequence modification function like `replace`, `insert`, or `pop` are not available since they manipulate the original sequence. Second, other functions like `sort` or `reverse` are not part of the `tuple` object itself; instead, we must use built-in Python functions: `sorted` and `reversed`. Note, the two functions return lists; to make a new tuple from them, we must create a tuple from the returned iterator as shown in the following Code cell.\n",
